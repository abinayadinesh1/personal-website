        This app was the grand prize winner for the 2020 MTA Back on Track
        Hackathon. My team and I worked collaboratively over a one-week period
        to create an app using Artificial Intelligence that would make ridership

        This project was the UIPath winner at the 2020 Hobby Hacks hackathon.
        Using the Spotify API, React JS, Firebase, and UI Path, over a span of
        two days, we were able to construct a Spotify based community for music
        lovers and enthusiasts to communicate and meet new people with
        customized Spotify-based profiles.
